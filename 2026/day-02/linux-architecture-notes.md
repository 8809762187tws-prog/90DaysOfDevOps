A. LINUX ARCHITECTURE

    It has for layers.
    1. The outer most layer is where the Application runs( the user interface ).
    2. Next is the Shell ( where shell commands are used for interaction with the Kernel.
    3. Third layer is Kernel(Heart of the linux architecture) also called the Linux-Kernel.
       It runs a computer program in C which converts C program to binary.
    4. Fourth layer is the Computer Hardware.


  This Linux architecture works on CLI (command line interface).


B. Linux commands use very freequently.
   1. ls - command to list files in a directory.
   2. pwd - to print the present working directory.
   3. cd - to change working directory.
   4. ping - to check connectivity of an ip address or a website.
   5. ls -l - to list files (with details).

C. Linux processes state.
   1. running - The process is currently executing on CPU.
   2. stopped - Process is paused.
   3. Uninterruptible sleep (I/O) - 
   4. sleeping - Process is waiting for something, can be woken up by signals.
   5. Zombie - Finished execution.
